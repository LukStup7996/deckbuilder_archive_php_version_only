"# deckbuilder_archive_php_version_only" 

After 6 moonths of programming and working on a project all by myself I have decided to finally properly document this pet project of mine on GitHub. 
Intended as a part of my portfolio, I chose to create a SPA that combines one of my favourite hobbies, trading cards, with the skills I have acquired over the past two years,  during my studies at the Unviversity of Applied Scieneces Technikum Wien and beyond that. 
Now as the title suggest this is ONLY the backend version. The reasoning behind this is, that I am very pleased by how smoothly this particular version of my PHP backend looks and operates, BUT I have encountered a particular error, that requires me to now, after 6 months, make significant changes within the logic of my backend.
And since I am very happy with this version, I chose to create a seperate repository to share and more importantly to highlight the differences between the pure backend version and the later integrated fullstack version.

When brainstorming on what kind of programming language I wanted to code in, I had a lot of choices. But there was one language I excelled at, PHP. Which posed even more choices, simple backend, WP or maybe a fullstack. And enthused as I am, I chose the latter. 
The reasons for those are rather simple, it just suits me and it lets me share my understanding of an interface and all its integral parts. I have spent most of my time studying and practicing PHP, HTML, CSS and Javascript during my time at University, so it should naturally be my choice of programming language when it comes down to creating a project. After all, that was a major part of my education, which I comparitively enjoyed a lot.

So why PHP? Well it is, as far as my understanding goes, probably the most common interfacing language that is used when communicating with a database. A lot of servers use PHP not only because of its simplicity, Id' like to call it, but also because of its rather good security. PHP cannot communicate with anything but a database on its own. So in order to circumvent that, CORS was implemented. A rules violating script, that allows the communication of server environments to specific websites, depending on specific configurations of the server environment. It is also part of a few free server environments like laravel or xampp, which makes it easily accessible for anyone.

Now I personally use xampp, since it is the server environment I am used to the most, but I have made sure that you should be able to run this project from quite frankly any server environment.

So how does it work?
In genereal the deckbuilder_archive can be compared to any other online web page that has a searchbar/archive/browsing function, a shoppingbasket, as well as a receipt system and user created contents. In a sense it functions exactly the same as any other online shop, hotel or booking site. 

There are a lot of files. What for?
Well since documentation, requirements engineering and project management, also made up a huge part of my studies, I am also somewhat versed in actually analyzing a projects need, planning that project and communicate its intricacies in a proper and understandable fashion. At least I hope that these additional files will help properly communicate what the project can do and should do, how it was created and so on. For the purpose of clearly understanding the project and as a part of my portfolio, I have created not only requirements documents, but also my own user stories, as well as a kanban board (GitHub is amazing, for having an integrated version) and different paper-prototypes. These will be shared in the next repository though. 
In the hopes of keeping somewhat of an orderly manner, I will split the documentation between the backend and the frontend, especially since I need to alter my backend, so that I can focus on finalizing MS 7, in a manner that doesn't require configurations of specific server environments, in particular xampp. I want this project to be easily accesible and setup for anyone who wants to try it out, so I need to find a solution that doesn't force users to run my pet project in a particular way.
